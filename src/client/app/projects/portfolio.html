		<h2>Portfolio</h2>
		<p>
			This portfolio is a Durandal application running on a super-thin NodeJS server (it just serves the index page, and statically serves the images). It is hosted on a self-managed Webfaction box which I deploy to with Git over SSH, where a post-receive hook unpacks the repo and restarts <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/forever">Forever</a>. A cron-job ensures that Forever is started every 15 minutes. I learned how to do the ssh deploy and linux setup bits over the course of building this project. The client is built with Grunt, using JSLint, HTMLHint, and Grunt-Durandal. The source is on <a href="https://github.com/tyrsius/portfolio">Github</a>.
