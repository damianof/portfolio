			NW Maico &amp; CZ was an online store for a motorcycle parts company. The application was build using KnockoutJS, a popular javascript MV* library that provides data-binding via "observables". I also used SammyJS to give the application single-page hash-navigation. Purchasing was handled with PayPal.
