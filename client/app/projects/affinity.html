		<h2>Affinity</h2>

		<p>Affinity was my first professional solo application. It was a ground-up re-write in WPF of a aging Windows Forms application. I was very lucky with this project, I was able to develop it under ideal conditions. Redoing an existing application means knowing most of the business problems you are trying to solve, while also having a wealth of existing feedback, positive and negative, for the existing solutions. I had spent a year using the existing application, and another year developing on it. The application was a help desk ticketing system and parts ordering &amp; inventory managment tool for internal employees, so I had direct access to its users. Feedback on new interfaces and bugs was immediate. My users were technical, which is helpful in so many ways.</p>

		<p>The development process taught me a lot about WPF, but more importantly about the process of developing new software. I learned how to manage feature priority between users and managers, to coordinate releases with both a beta team and the call center as a whole, and to set the expectations for both.
