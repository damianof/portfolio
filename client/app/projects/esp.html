		<h2>ESP</h2>

		<p>
			I joined ShiftWise, the company who developed and sold VMS, after it had been their primary product for several years. It was my first work on a large team. ESP was a vendor managed system (VMS) for contigent medical staffing, who primary purpose was to handle the miles of red tape associated with vetting a nurse with the requriements, licensing, and verification associated with federally regulated hosptials. It's developed started in ASP Web Forms 1.0, but portions of the softwae had been updated piecemeal over the decade of use before I started. All of the original developers had left the company, so work was often very slow, and requried unguided research on the existing implementation before begining. Initially, I was responsble for minor feature requests from client's.

			The first major project I worked on in ESP was overhauling the billing system to allow for much finer grained tracking of expenses and non-hourly billing (such as mileage and training costs). Coupled with the finer points of our client billing, which included integrating with various local tax policies, it was very in-depth. The project took about six months, but experienced very positive feedback immediatly upon launch.

		The second major project in ESP involved allowing for a differentkind of contigent position: flexible work. Normal jobs had set start and end times, and the the entire job matching system (which inluded verifying eligible staff had the time unbooked to other jobs) relied on this static information. Flexible jobs were requests for work that had no set time, and allowed the staff applying to the job to offer their own start and end time. Once again, this required extensive refactoring of critical parts of the application. Though a few issues came up after the initial relese, we resolved them quickly and the overall feedback was very positive. Due to contractual obligations, I cannot discuss the specifics of this systems implementation, but it did not disrupt the normal workflow for contigent orders.
